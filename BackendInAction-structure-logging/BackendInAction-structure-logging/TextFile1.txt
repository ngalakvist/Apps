 ***String interpolation***

Developers have been doing it for a long time. Because of:

Simplicity.
Single-string logs are straightforward. Easy to implement and easy to read. 
Almost all of logging libraries support single-stringing out of the box.
Developers can quickly add such logs to a method using placeholders for variables.

Human-Readability.
Logs in a single-string format are often human-readable at a glance. 
As we can see in the example, they are usually simple sentences.

Legacy. 
 In legacy systems or environments, it may be not necessary or even impossible to change existed single-string logs. So,
 the side-systems may use the same approach in order to unify the whole system.


***Structured logging(templating)***

Context-informative. 
Allows you to include additional data along with the log message. 
This can provide more context to the log entry, for example user Id, request Id, app version and so on, making it easier to understand and analyze.
  
Machine-readable: 
As long as logs now objects with properties, they are machine-readable, 
which is extremely beneficial when you’re dealing with large volumes of logs and want to process them programmatically or with aggregation tools.

Searchable and filterable.
It becomes easier to search and filter logs based on specific criteria. 
There are lot of apps is being used for that. 
This is particularly valuable when dealing with distributed systems and microservices.

Enhanced-analyzable. 
'Structured logs are usually stored in some db.
Which give us ability to do more sophisticated analysis.
Tools can extract information from the structured data easy, without parsing.

Consistency.
Structured logging encourages a consistent format for logs across different parts of the application, 
making it easier to correlate information and trace issues.
